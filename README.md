## Description
The Ticket class represents a concert ticket with attributes such as ID, concert hall, event code, timestamp, promo status, stadium sector, backpack weight limit, and price. The class ensures proper input formats for ID, concert hall, and event code, and includes overloaded methods for setting an ID if not provided. A timestamp records ticket creation, while toString() returns all details in a human-readable format.
